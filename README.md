yet effective task management system developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project is to help users organize their daily activities by allowing them to create, view, update, and manage tasks efficiently.The application enables users to add new tasks, which are immediately displayed in the Pending Tasks section. Once a task is completed, users can mark it as Completed, and the task is automatically moved to a separate Completed Tasks list. This clear separation helps users track their progress and manage their workload effectively.Additionally, the application allows users to edit or delete tasks from both pending and completed lists, ensuring flexibility and ease of use. To enhance functionality, the system records the date and time when a task is added and when it is completed, providing better task tracking.
